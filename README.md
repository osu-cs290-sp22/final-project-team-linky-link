Inspired by the movie Clueless, a website where people can upload pictures of their clothes and have an outfit generated for them is our idea. This is an opportunity to help people who are not sure what to wear by having an app that generates an outfit from their closet for them. For sake of time, weâ€™ll already have preloaded shirts and pants the user can choose from.
