Inspired by the movie Clueless, our final project idea is a website where people can upload pictures of their clothes and have an outfit generated for them. This is an opportunity to help people who are not sure what to wear by having an app that generates an outfit from their closet for them. 

For sake of time, our prototype will already have preloaded shirts and pants the user can choose from.

Once the user chooses a shirt and pants, they can create their outfit and give it a name. After this, the user can submit their outfit and have their final choice displayed on a new page.

## 1. User data
    * User's selected outfit
    * User's name for outfit
